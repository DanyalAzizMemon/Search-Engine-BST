# Console-Based Search Engine using Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Code File
The code for this project is implemented in the `code.cpp` file.

## Implementation Overview
This project aims to develop a console-based search engine using a Binary Search Tree (BST). The core functionality includes parsing data from a file, building a BST from the extracted data, and enabling keyword-based search functionality to retrieve relevant URLs.

## Tasks
### Task 1:
Task 1 involves setting up the interface for the search engine. The implemented console-based interface allows users to load data from a file, input keywords to search, and handles invalid input gracefully.

### Task 2:
Task 2 focuses on implementing the search engine using a Binary Search Tree (BST). This involves:
- Parsing keywords from the input data and storing them in the BST.
- Associating each keyword with the corresponding URL(s) where it appears.
- Enabling search functionality to retrieve URLs based on user-input keywords.
- Implementing basic BST operations such as insertion, search, and deletion.

## Data Structures Used
The primary data structure utilized in this project is a Binary Search Tree (BST). The BST facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of keyword-URL pairs, allowing for quick keyword-based searches. Additionally, arrays and strings are used for data manipulation and processing.
